However, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason.

                        <br /><span>The User understands and acknowledges that User is engaging CAI as their authorized agent to file on their behalf in class action settlements. User acknowledges and understands that User is not required to use a third party agent for filing and prior to retaining CAI to file on their behalf, may choose to file without assistance.
