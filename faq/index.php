              <b>What is Class Action?</b>
              <p>'Class Action' is a third party claims-filing service provided by our company; Class Action, Inc. We act as filing and recovery agent for thousands of consumer class members, and closely monitor hundreds of federal class action settlements every day on their behalf.</p>
              
              
              <b>How does the Class Action service work, exactly?</b>
              <p>First, we aggregate thousands of pages of claim forms each year, and simplify them into as few questions as we (responsibly) can. When clients log into our platform, we're able to determine eligibility for dozens of settlements at a time, completely automating the filing and collection process.<br/>
                Our 5% success fee allows us to operate independently without relying on advertising or other third-party revenue - and was designed purposefully to bind our interests to those of our eligible class member clients - we can't win without you winning, too.
              </p>
              
              <b>How do I receive claim money?</b>
              <p>Most class actions have a court-ordered 'distribution schedule'. Once we receive payment from the settlement administrator, we deduct a 5% transaction fee (per our <a id="footerUserAgree" href="javascript:void(0)">user agreement</a>), and send the rest of the payment to you either in the form of a physical check or ACH bank transfer.</p>

              <b>How much money will I receive?</b>
              <p>Every class action lawsuit is different, and final payment amounts can depend on a variety of court rulings and other factors. Your payments can range from a few dollars to many thousands - it really just depends on the individual settlement. Of course, we'll do everything we can to ensure you have the most up to date information on how much to expect, when to expect it, and any other factors which might influence the value of your claim, or your rights as a class member - and if you ever have specific questions, simply send us a note and we'll do what we can to help.</p>

              <b>How long will it take for me to receive my money?</b>
              <p>Unfortunately there is no set amount of time it takes to receive an award for many class action settlements. Rather, the 'distribution schedule' for payments is determined by court rulings, and is pretty much out of our hands. That said, we do our level-best to offer approximations on when you will receive your award, and have a small team dedicated to keeping you (as well as ourselves) as up to date as possible.</p>

              <b>How do I start a class action lawsuit against a company?</b>
              <p>We get asked this frequently and whilst we do have attorneys on the team, we are <b>definitely not a law firm</b>, and <b>cannot help start a class action lawsuit</b>, or <b>give legal advice of any kind to anyone, ever, period.</b>
              Now... We'd be lying if we said we didn't build this company to empower individual consumers - but even if it WAS legal for us to help in this way - there's a non-zero likelihood it could lead to ethical conflicts in the future, and (we suspect) make certain judges... grumpier than they need to be.
              (Note: As a company, this is also why we've chosen not accept offers of investment from litigators on the plaintiffs or defense bar. We're in this for the long run.)</p>
              
              <b>What does this service cost?</b>
              <p>It's free to join and maintain an active subscription, and we deduct a 5% transaction fee from settlement distributions collected on your behalf. For example, if you have $100 in claim-value, we'll send a $95 check (or bank transfer) as the settlement is distributed. There are no other fees, and if we ever DO change in this the future (though we have no plans to do so) we promise to tell you long in advance. You can read more about this fee in our <a id="footerUserAgreement" href="javascript:void(0)">user agreement</a>.</p>

              <b>Do you know about this lawsuit?</b>
              <p>If you're aware of an existing class action lawsuit and you’re looking for more information, we’d be happy to help where we can! Simply send the name of the lawsuit (or any other details you have) to our support staff at <a href="mailto:support@classactioninc.com">support@classactioninc.com</a>. They’ll research the settlement and get back to you with what we can find. (Please be patient, there are many thousands of class actions each year, many of them going on for over a decade... we promise to respond sooner than that though - usually within 48 hours.)</p>

              <b>Can I update my account information?</b>
              <p>Of course! Email us with the changes you would like to make, or tell Clarence you'd like to edit your information and he’ll help you make the changes manually.</p>

              <b>How can I get in contact with you?</b>
              <p>You can always reach out to us over the phone by calling 1 (888) 557-3885 or by emailing <a href="mailto:support@classactionapp.com">support@classactionapp.com</a>. Our physical address is 2777 Alvarado St. Suite E, San Leandro, CA 94577 (We love mail!)</p>

              <b>What if I filed a claim elsewhere?</b>
              <p>Unfortunately, if you don't file your claim with us, we're unable to look up its status. You'll have to contact the settlement administrator directly to do that. You can likely find their contact information online, or on postcard or email notices they have sent you.</p>

              <b>Can I cancel my account?</b>
              <p>We're more than happy to cancel your account at any time. The only limitation is that if you’ve already submitted claims through our service then we will need your express permission to invalidate and delete your claim information as well. If you would still like to cancel your account, you can reach out to support staff at support@classactioninc.com and tell them that you would like to cancel your account and delete all claims filed through our service. (If you do decide to do this, we hope you'll tell us why!)</p>


              <b>Why do I need your company / service?</b>
              <p>You don't, of course! That said, monitoring thousands of lawsuits a year and turning mountains of dense legalese into plain language keeps our modest-sized team pretty gosh darn busy... We've been told our product is useful 'simply for the awareness factor', though we like to believe the work we invest into minimizing physical paper filings, aggregating payments, and educating consumers about their rights is useful, too.</p>


              <b>What does suing do to prevent corporate wrongdoing?</b>
              <p>A number of studies have looked into this very question (we'll be making a list of these soon!). Generally speaking, we believe as long as consumer rights are cheaper to abuse than protect, that a ( generally small) percentage of companies will continue do so.<br/>
              The resultant harm to society is comes in two main forms; Direct harm to consumers and businesses connected to specific illegal activity, as well as the indirect (but very real) harm to legitimate businesses trying to compete on an uneven playing field. <br/>
              On a more personal note, our company aims to contribute to what free market capitalism aims to achieve by encouraging transparent law and corporate accountability... which we believe to be necessary in the pursuit and maintenance of a truly free marketplace.<br/></p>
              


              <b>Is this a scam?</b>
              <p>Look, we understand why 'free money on the internet' sounds pretty suspicious. All you have to do is fill out an online form and you get free money? Sounds too good to be true! The reality is, however, that the money really isn't free. Every time you over-paid for a guarantee which under-delivered, or were charged for a service never provided, received unsolicited phone-calls without your consent, or were otherwise lied to, stolen from, or harmed by a large organization who stood to benefit by doing so... That's where the money comes from. We charge a five percent 'success fee' instead sign-up, subscription, or other kinds of fees, because we believe it's the most reliable way to ensure our interests are aligned with your own. (It also means there's no need for us to sell your data, which we do not and will never do!) It’s smart to be wary of websites that ask for your information, but our whole mission is about holding companies accountable, and we can’t do that if we’re acting in bad faith. If you trust us enough to look after our mutual interests in this small area of the world, we can promise we'll do our best to earn that trust in the years to come.</p>


              <b>So… are you lawyers?</b>
              <p>Nope - and we don't pretend to be lawyers on the internet! I mean, we have an attorney on the team… her name is Meg and she’s really nice! But we’re mostly just people helping other people find the money from class action lawsuits that they didn’t know they had. Oh - and a robot bear. We have one of those, too.</p>
